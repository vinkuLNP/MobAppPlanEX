<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
LNP Plan Execute Next ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy.
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information
when you use the Plan Execute Next mobile application.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email address and basic profile information (via Google Sign-In)</li>
  <li>User identifiers for authentication purposes</li>
  <li>Tasks, reminders, and preferences entered by the user</li>
  <li>Limited app usage data for reliability and performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>We use your information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate users securely</li>
  <li>Provide task planning and reminder functionality</li>
  <li>Send notifications and daily summaries based on user preferences</li>
  <li>Improve app stability and user experience</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Notifications & Alarms</h2>
<p>
Plan Execute Next sends notifications only after the user explicitly enables them.
These notifications include task reminders and a daily summary.
</p>

<p>
The daily summary notification is delivered at a predefined time (currently 10:30 AM)
to provide users with a consistent overview of their completed and pending tasks.
</p>

<p>The app may request the following permissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</strong> – to display reminders and daily summaries</li>
  <li><strong>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</strong> – to restore scheduled notifications after device restart</li>
  <li><strong>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</strong> – to deliver reminders and daily summaries at a specific predefined time (for example, 10:30 AM)</li>
</ul>

<p>
All notifications are scheduled <strong>locally on the user’s device</strong>.
The app does <strong>not</strong> use server-based push notifications or Firebase Cloud Messaging.
Notifications can be disabled at any time through device settings or within the app.
</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use the following third-party services to provide app functionality:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Sign-In</strong> – for user authentication using a Google account</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> – for secure user login and identity management</li>
  <li><strong>Firebase Firestore</strong> – for storing user-created data such as tasks and reminders</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not sell, rent, or share personal or sensitive user data with third parties
for advertising or marketing purposes.
</p>


<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>
We use industry-standard security measures to protect user data.
Data is transmitted securely and access is restricted.
</p>

<h2>6. Account Deletion & Data Retention</h2>
<p>
Users may request deletion of their account and associated personal data at any time.
Account deletion can be initiated in the following ways:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>From within the app via <strong>Settings → Delete Account</strong></li>
  <li>By submitting an account deletion request using our web form:
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdt9pbpJDg_sqTHSq1WOtpUP8GpKDFfdTI4GPwN_oNdcHp38A/viewform" target="_blank">Account Deletion Request Form</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Once a deletion request is verified, the user’s account and all associated personal data
stored in Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore are permanently deleted.
</p>

<p>
Certain non-personal or minimal data may be retained if required for legal,
security, fraud prevention, or regulatory compliance purposes.
</p>

<p>
We retain user data only for as long as necessary to provide app functionality
or to comply with legal obligations.
When an account is deleted, personal data is permanently removed from our systems
unless retention is required by law.
